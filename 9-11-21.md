# Removing canvas texture from scanned painting
Hey all, I want to share a personal breakthrough I had while painting textures for PyraMaze  

When downscaling a scanned-painting to pixel art, I noticed really bad noise as a result of the canvas texture still visible in the scan. So I had to figure out how to remove the canvas texture from image. This led me to figuring out how to use Fourier Transform plugins. 

I made this diagram to explain the process.
