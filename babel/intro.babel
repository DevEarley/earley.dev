About me: My name is Alex Earley, I am a freelance software developer with over 10 years of professional experience. I live in Portland, Maine with my wife and two cats. I have been a professional software developer since I graduated from F.A.U. in 2013. I have worked on teams big and small. I have worked as a developer and as a hands-off team lead. I have shipped many projects to some very big clients (see my resume for more on that). My full time job has typically been working on web applications, but since 2014 I have been working on Unity3D games as a hobby.
