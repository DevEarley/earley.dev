# PyraMaze Devlog - September 2021 Release - Bees! [DRAFT]

The 32BitJam has started again and this time the theme is Bees! For this release I decided to build an area in the game that is self-contained and features a new character controller. I also wanted to see if I could put my acrylic painting skills to use and paint some textures for this release. Towards the end of the jam, I realized I needed music. So I plugged in some headphones and made some songs on my iPhone. In this devlog, I will explain my process for each of these things and help you understand how I built the september release of PyraMaze!
