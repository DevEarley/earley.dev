# Bye FB. Bye IG.

I left Instagram today. I left Facebook awhile ago. I don't see myself going back. It's kinda like a breakup. I downloaded all of my posts and I had to type in my password in order to make it official. In a breakup, you get a box of your shit and the question: "Are you sure?".

I will miss those people I was connected to. But really, I haven't talked to most of them anyways. If they need me - I am on twitter: [@devearley](https://twitter.com/devearley) ... For now.

 I don't use aim or tumblr either. I left myspace too. Times change and we move on.
